# TIC TAC TOE

I created this well-known game as a way to enhance my understanding and practice of Java programming.


## Game Rules

- The aim of the game is to form a sequence of three identical symbols, which can be aligned either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Simultaneously, players strive to prevent their opponent from achieving the same sequence.
- The game commences with the player labeled as "X," and this designation alternates after each turn. This means that the player who starts as "X" in one round will become "O" in the next, ensuring a fair and balanced gameplay.
